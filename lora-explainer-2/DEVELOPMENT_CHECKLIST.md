# Development Checklist for LoRA Training Process Visualization

## Overview
This checklist outlines the tasks for implementing the new, fully animated training process visualization that replaces the previous step-by-step approach with fluid, continuous animation.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Setup and Dependencies
- [x] Ensure react-spring is properly imported and available
- [ ] Review other animation libraries available in the project (visx, tw-animate-css)
- [ ] Test react-spring animations in isolated environment if needed

### 2. Component Structure
- [x] Define reusable animated components (AnimatedPath, AnimatedRect, AnimatedCircle)
- [x] Implement animation state management (progress, speed controls, animation loop)
- [x] Establish responsive layout for all screen sizes

### 3. Animation Implementation
- [x] Implement continuous animation loop using requestAnimationFrame
- [x] Create progress-based stage transitions
- [x] Add data flow visualization with moving elements
- [x] Implement spring-based animations for highlight effects

### 4. Visual Elements
- [x] Design base model representation
- [x] Design LoRA adapter representation
- [x] Create data flow paths and animated elements
- [x] Implement stage indicators and labels

### 5. User Controls
- [x] Add animation start/pause toggle
- [x] Implement animation speed control
- [x] Add reset functionality
- [x] Create clear stage descriptions that update with animation

### 6. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize animation frame rate and smoothness
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Test on lower-powered devices
- [ ] Implement animation throttling if needed

### 7. Accessibility
- [ ] Ensure controls are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Add appropriate ARIA attributes
- [ ] Provide alternative text descriptions
- [ ] Test with screen readers

### 8. Integration
- [ ] Update any parent components that reference the visualization
- [ ] Ensure correct props are passed to the component
- [ ] Test integration with the full application flow

### 9. Visual Testing
- [ ] Test across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify animations work correctly at different screen sizes
- [ ] Confirm proper layout at mobile breakpoints

### 10. Documentation
- [ ] Add code comments explaining animation approaches
- [ ] Document key animation parameters and how to adjust them
- [ ] Create usage examples for other developers
- [ ] Update any existing documentation referencing the old visualization

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding detailed tooltips for each stage
- Explore 3D effects for more engaging visualization
- Add custom easing functions for smoother transitions
- Implement interactive elements that respond to user clicks
